<h1>Who are we?</h1>

<img src="Music_Club.jpg"/>
<p> We are a group of student who love music and decided to come together and create a club where anyone can express their own sound and in this we may all learn from one another and in turn we all get to get exposed to different sound. </p>
<p> Unlike other clubs we host events every weekend so as to give everyone a chance/platform to showcase themselves<p>
<p>It is R350 to join the club and with this money we maintain instruments and buy new ones if needed<p>
